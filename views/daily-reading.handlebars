            I know that you are pissed off and stressed out this week, but your revenge tactics suck when you are not thinking clearly. You’ve kept this problem inside for too long. So long, it’s been scratching at your bad side and it now starting to really itch. It’s time to finally get it off your chest and talk about it. I know that you would rather destroy something, but if you don’t solve the problem this week, it will be twice as bad next week!
