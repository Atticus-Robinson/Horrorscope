          Your car will begin pulling slightly to the center. Your paranoia is
          justified. Your next career: Sad Clown Painter. You will develop an
          attractive skin condition. Lately, life has been a box of cereal: all
          bran, no marshmallows. That changes on Saturday, when someone new
          shows up and excites all your fruity bits. Youâ€™ll even feel like
          licking the spoon.

          You consider yourself a born leader. Others think you are an idiot. You are vain and cannot tolerate criticism. Your arrogance is disgusting. You are the reason butterfly hairpins and parachute pants have made a comeback. Don't sleep, Shriners want to eat you. If you want to connect with young folks, just provide them with solid wi-fi.
