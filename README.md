# Horrorscope

=======
## Description
---------------------
Whether it is your guilty pleasure or not, most people know what their astrology sign is and as general rule, the traits of their sign. 
This app locks into that. We give you a conversation piece for the day if you see it more of hocus pocus or it allows you to plan your day for the worst if you take stock in horoscopes.  
Basic principle - user puts in information about themselves (birthday, location etc.) and they're given a series of personalized things about how bad their day could be. Negative horoscope items, nearby catastrophic weather events, pandemic spikes around them, news related events.
