# Horrorscope

=======
## Description
---------------------
Basic principle - user puts in information about themselves (birthday, location etc.) and they're given a series of personalized things about how bad their day could be. Negative horoscope items, nearby catastrophic weather events, pandemic spikes around them, news related events  
Sounds pretty serious at first :laughing: but I think that once we dress it up with a sort of eldritch, fortune teller type theme it'll be a unique and distinctive project
Pros - good and distinct base concept and visual theme Cons - may be difficult to hit all of the project requirements
